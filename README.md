# Vehicle-detection-and-tracking-Using-OpenCv
In this Project we detect the vehicle on the road.
We use Background subtraction alogo's to detect the changes on the frame, from a frame which has been previously trained for 500 frames.
we then clean the background and detct the vehicles based on contours
